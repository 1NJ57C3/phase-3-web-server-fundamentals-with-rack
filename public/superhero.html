        <h4>Lyrics:</h4>
        <p>
            [Verse 1]<br>
            <em>
                Everybody says goodbye too fast<br>
                But nobody quicker than you did<br>
                Cutting our strings like they're useless<br>
                Everybody lies with their hands tied back<br>
                But nobody better than you did<br>
                Like the truth is useless to you
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            <em>
                All I ever wanted was somebody who stays<br>
                But the knife that's in my back is from the promise you made
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Chorus]<br>
            <em>
                You... made me<br>
                believe<br>
                You were the savior I was waiting for<br>
                But you're not a superhero<br>
                'Cause you... made me<br>
                believe<br>
                You'd hold the world underneath my feet<br>
                But you're not a superhero<br>
                To me anymore
            </em>

            [Verse 2]<br>
            <em>
                Funny how...<br>
                You'd make everyone laugh<br>
                To cover up all of your issues<br>
                The parts that nobody would see through, they know you<br>
                But you don't wanna change it<br>
                'Cause you know you get away with it<br>
                For now. For now...
